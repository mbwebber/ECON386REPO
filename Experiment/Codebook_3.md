# Group 3 Codebook

## Variable Key for Task 1
Variable Name | Definition
------------- | ----------
Subject | Test subject unique identifier for each of the 30 participants.
Activity | Type of motion activity the subject is measured performing: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying.
Features | Detailed measurements of specific types of signals captured while the subjects performed the observed activities.

## Feature Abbreviation Key
Each activity has a description comprised of a combination of abbreviated terms. An example description, "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" would translate to the *mean* measurement in the *time domain,* of *acceleration* from the wearer's *body,* across the *X-axis*. 

Abbreviation | Definition
------------- | ----------
Acc | Indicates data taken from a device's accelerometer.
Body | Indicates measurements derived from the acceleration of the wearer's body.
f | Indicates frequency domain signals.
Gravity | Indicates measurements derived from the acceleration of gravity.
Gyro | Indicates data taken from a device's gyroscope.
Jerk | Signals derived from the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the wearer's body in three dimensions (XYZ).
Mag | Calculated magnitude of the signals recorded.
Mean | The mean value of a given measurement.
Std | The standard deviation of a given measurement.
t | Denotes time doman signal. 
X | Data for the X-axis of motion.
Y | Data for the Y-axis of motion.
Z | Data for the Z-axis of motion.


## Data for Task 1
The raw data for Task 1 was provided in eight (8) plain text files. Each of these files represented a portion of the overall dataset that our group combined and refined to create our final product. 

Data File | Description
------------- | ----------
X_test.txt | Testing data for all measured features. Testing data comprised 30% of the dataset.
X_train.txt | Training data for all measured features. Training data comprised 70% of the dataset.
Y_test.txt | A file comprised of a single column of values which mate with X_test.txt.
Y_train.txt | A file comprised of a single column of values which mate with Y_test.txt
activity_labels.txt | A file with two columns which match a numeric value code 1:6 with the proper activity.
features.txt | A text file with all 561 feature variables captured in data collection. For this exercise, we only used a portion of these features.
subject_test.txt | A file with a column of numbers 1:30 corresponding to the subjects in the test data.
subject_train.txt | A file with a column of numbers 1:30 corresponding to the subjects in the training data.



## Task 1 Cleaning Process

1. Create data frames by simultaneously importing the text files and converting them into tbl_df format. 
2. Bind the testing and training rows for the subject, labels and features data. 
3. Change the column names for the subjects, labels, and features data. 
4. Remove the first column of “variable_names”.
5. Change the format of "variable_names" to characters, so it can replace the column names of "data”. 
6. Combine subjects, labels, and data to create the full dataset.
7. Use the dplyr chain to select the features that contain the means  and standard deviations.
8. Group by subject and activity. 
9. Compute the group averages.  
10. Change the activity names from numbers to descriptive labels.
11. Save the final dataset as tidy1.txt

## Variable Key for *tidy2.txt*, *tidy2_a.txt*, and *tidy2_b.txt*

Variable Name | Definition
------------- | ----------
Electricity | Daily average of electrical generation produced in MWh
Year| Year of observation
SO2 | Daily average of sulfur dioxide emitted in short tons
NOx | Daily average of nitrous oxides emitted in short tons
Capital | Capital stock measured in 2017 USD
Employees | Number of employees 
Coal_hc | Daily average heat content of coal in MWh
Oil_hc | Daily average heat content of oil in MWh
Gas_hc | Daily average heat content of natural gas in MWh
CAA | Dummy indicating if Phase I of CAA had been announced; equals 1 if the year is 1990 or later

##Task 2 Data
Data was retrieved from a 2006 study by Carl Pasurka on electrical production and pollutant emission. The study takes data from 92 plants between the years of 1985 and 1995 that is presented in a text file *Panel_8595.txt*.

## Task 2 Cleaning Process
1. Column names were changed simultaneously with data importation to descriptive titles.
2. Unnecessary columns were dropped, leaving only the Plant ID, year, input variables, and output variables.
3. Electrical output was converted from annual production measured in kWh to daily averages measured in MWh.
4. Heat contents of coal, oil, and natural gas were converted from annual totals measured in Btu to daily averages in MWh.
5. Capital stock was converted from 1973 USD to 2017 USD.
6. A factor variable was created to indicate if Phase I restrictions of the Clean Air Act had been announced.
7. For *tidy2_a.txt*, table represents averages for each company accross all time periods.
8. For *tidy2_b.txt*, table represents aggregates for all companies in each time period.
